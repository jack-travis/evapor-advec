find way of making evaporation depend on total moisture (rv AND rl)
look up dr_cond?

		[[[replace total variation measure with kinetic energy]]]

filenames and arrangement

reanalyse model's stability



mention initial state
mention variable names and definitions
state equations in problem desc
mathematical variable names
mention finite difference scheme

state B&F cond equation
justify
explain implementation

change equations and redo analysis
numerical stability of evapor/cond
stability of whole equation
describe C>1 errors based on this
evapor/cond suppresses oscillations if u is small
look for boundary
merge into main document and detailify

add various references for equations used
